# Corona Exporter #

If you have a Corona application or game that targets more than one resolution using the image suffix functionality that Corona provides (@2x, @4x, etc.), you can use this application to export your Corona App to a specific resolution. You can reduce the size of your app by 2 or 3 times which makes it more easy to download by users.

## Installation ##

It was developed using Visual Studio 2013 Express. Just open the solution and run it. If anyone is interested and doesn't want to build it, I can provide a binary on request.
